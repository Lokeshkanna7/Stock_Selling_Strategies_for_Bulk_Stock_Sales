# Stock Selling Strategies Analysis

This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to exploring various stock selling strategies through comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning. The notebook is structured in two main parts: Big Data Processing and Machine Learning.

## Part 1: Big Data Processing
This section focuses on preparing and exploring the dataset to make it suitable for machine learning models.

### Task 1: Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Load the dataset and explore its metadata.
- Clean the dataset by checking and imputing missing values.
- Convert date formats and compute basic statistics for each numerical feature.
- Visualize the closing prices over time using Matplotlib.

### Task 2: Feature Engineering
- Compute daily returns and moving averages.
- Normalize trading volumes using Min-Max Scaling.
- Analyze and visualize new features.

### Task 3: Data Visualization
- Create histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps to understand the data distributions and relationships.

## Part 2: Machine Learning
This section applies various machine learning techniques to predict stock price movements and classify trends.

### Task 1: Clustering with KMeans
- Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Interpret clusters to gain insights into stock price behaviors.

### Task 2: Other Machine Learning Methods
- Implement Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes for price prediction and trend analysis.
- Use k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for trend classification.
- Additional algorithms like RandomForest Regressor and SVM are used for bonus points.

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
